    body:
      'Diabetic retinopathy is eye damage caused by diabetes. Over time, high blood sugar can weaken the tiny blood vessels in the retina - the light-sensing layer at the back of your eye. Those vessels can leak, swell, or close off, and in later stages the eye may grow new, fragile vessels. It is one of the most common causes of vision loss in adults with diabetes - and one of the most preventable when it is caught early.',

    title: 'Why it can be silent',
    body:
      'In its early stages, diabetic retinopathy usually has no warning signs. Your eyes can feel completely normal while small changes are already starting. That is exactly why a yearly screening matters even when your vision seems fine - it can find changes long before you would ever notice them.',
  },
  {
    id: 'risk',
    title: 'What raises the risk',
    body:
      'Your risk goes up the longer you have diabetes and the higher your blood sugar (A1C) runs over time. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, and pregnancy can add to it. The good news: keeping these under control lowers your risk and helps protect your sight.',

    title: 'What the screening is like',
    body:
      'The screening is quick and painless. A special camera takes a photo of the back of your eye - no needles. Many mobile-camera and pharmacy sites use a camera that does not need dilating drops, so you can usually get back to your day right away. Some sites still use drops - the site can tell you ahead of time. The whole visit takes about 10 to 15 minutes.',

A navigator can help you with whatever comes next.",

If it reaches a more advanced stage, an eye doctor may recommend laser treatment or eye injections. Catching it early is the whole point of screening - it is when problems are easiest to manage and your vision is easiest to protect.',
